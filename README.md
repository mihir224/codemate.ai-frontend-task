# codemate.ai frontend task

I made this project as a submission for the frontend intern role at [codemate.ai](https://www.codemate.ai/). 

I have basically implemented file upload functionality with firebase storage as the backend and then I display all the uploaded files to the user on the download page that can be accessed by clicking the generate report button. The user can upload multiple files as well. 

You can visit the hosted site [here](https://mihir-codemate-ai.netlify.app/) 

I still have to implement the functionality where I make use of the piston API to execute the uploaded code files and return their result in the form of a generated pdf. 

## To get started

## Clone the repo

### `git clone https://github.com/mihir224/codemate.ai-frontend-task`

Thenm, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

to run the app in the development mode and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
